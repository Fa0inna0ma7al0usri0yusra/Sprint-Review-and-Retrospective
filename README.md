# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I started interpreting the user needs by listening to them and recieving the feedback on what they want/need and why they want x thing. It started with a meeting setup with some user's and asking them questions about what they want from the Vacation Packages Booking website then listening to them. Instead of focusing on our stakeholders soley and forcing advertisements and money making tactics into our product we first ensured the user gets what they want from the website. Creating user stories helps with this by keeping the focus on the user then using these user stories to break down these user stories into task that can be developed based on priority and size. This makes it easy for developers and testers by making it manageable for 2 to 1-week sprints. Overall user stories ensure our developement is providing value by fulfilling the user's expectations, feedback, and needs


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by focusing on iteraive and incremental developement which follow user feedback and a product backlog. I setup a meeting with the Product Owner to understand and update our product backlog to see what needs to be worked on and prioritized in the sprint. I hope to incorporate Backlog refinement, sprint planning and retrospectives into my future developement to help me be more flexible and have a user-focused approach to developement.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software developement it means that there needs to be clear and effective communication and accountability between the Product Owner, Developers, Testers, and Scrum Master. Every team member needs to participate in the daily stand-ups and other meetins aswell as respond in a timely manner to any emails or group-messages about a project to avoid delays. Not only should we soley focus on only our goals and current task but task that require collaberation should be done early to avoid delays. There should be trust and shared ownership between all team members in which they feel as if they are a family.
